# Love-is-in-the-Air
Love is in the Air is a fun generative art I developed in p5.js. It has a simple flocking simulation for the dynamic movement and interaction between particles and users. Sliders below can be used to manipulate the behavior of the flocking. The design is a visual metaphor illustrating how love is present everywhere, yet it is always just out of reach for the user. I also incorporated Laufey's song "Falling Behind" as it fits the theme of the design. 

Feel free to chase some hearts. You can try but I know you won't succeed.
